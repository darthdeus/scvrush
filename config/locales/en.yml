    map_info: |
      **All rounds until Quarter Finals BO1, the rest BO3, no Loser's Bracket**

      Map pool:

      - MLG Antiga Shipyard
      - MLG Cloud Kingdom
      - GSL Daybreak
      - MLG Entombed Valley
      - ESV Korhal Compound TE

      In BO1 rounds, you and your opponent each veto one map and you play the game on the remaining one.

      In BO3 rounds, the loser picks from the pool. Maps don't repeat, winner can veto one map.

      * **Format:** 1 1 3 3 3 etc.
      * **Example 1** - "1 3 3 5" means RO16 BO1, RO8 BO3, Semifinal BO3 and Finals BO5
      * **Example 2** - "1 1 1 3 3 3" means RO8 onward BO3, the rest BO1
      You can edit these settings before you create the seed, after you know how many checkins you have.

    map_preset: |
      Set one or multiple maps for each of your rounds, separate the rounds with a blank line (hit Enter two times).

      If you want your players to veto from the entire mappack, type the message (e.g. "veto from the map pool") and copy+paste it as if you were setting maps - see the [example](http://i.imgur.com/EaG6v.png) (it's a tournament with 6 rounds, so the message is pasted 6 times)

      You can set the maps manually after you generate the bracket (click on the name of the round).
